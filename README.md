# ray_tracer

Working through _The Ray Tracer Challenge_ book, by Jamis Buck,
implementing a 3D Renderer.

This Ray Tracer is the first program I have written in Rust, so the
module structure of the program is probably not the best,
and there are a lot of `foo.clone()` calls to keep the memory handling
and borrow checking as simple as possible.
